# Sweet-Corner
# Short Description of the Project
Sweet Corner is a Java Spring Boot Application. In this project I am using Java Spring Boot, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS and MySQL Database. It is an online sweet store where users can preview different kinds of sweets and add them to their shopping card. Users can also place an order and receive a confirmation email about their order. The website contains register and login functionalities.
